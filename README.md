# Important Must have aseprite extensions
All the scripts are well functioning with aseprite v1.3.10. Copy the support folder to the location where scripts folder is present for e.g. scripts are in folder `C:/User/Username/AppData/Aseprtie/scripts` then paste the support folder in Aseprite directory not in scripts directory. Extensions can be directly installed by double clicking them and copy and paste the scripts directory
